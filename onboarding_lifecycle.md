**Onboarding Is a Lifecycle, Not an Event**

1.  **Client Entry** Documentation intake, initial requirements clarification, expectation setting.
    
2.  **Validation & Setup** Account configuration, mandate checks, compliance validation.
    
3.  **Activation** Confirmation that the client can transact accurately and compliantly.
    
4.  **Stabilization** Early-life monitoring to catch onboarding defects before they impact trust.
    
5.  **Ongoing Maintenance** Changes, updates, and periodic reviews handled without reintroducing risk.
    

**Key Principle** Onboarding success is measured by _first-time-right activation_, not approval alone.
